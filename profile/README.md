# Adding developer CSS for Flair Themes

- Retrieve the store hash from the customer control panel URL
- Create a repo using the store hash as a name
- Add the client name to the repo description to identify it in the future
- Push a file named `custom.css` to the main branch for store CSS
- Push a file named `checkout.css` for checkout and order confirmation CSS
- Enable Developer Custom CSS in the global theme options panel in theme editor for appropriate files
- Note that stencil helpers do not work in these files
